/**
 * A collection of interfaces and classes used to parse an XML fragment. A fragment, in this
 * context, may be a simple, well-formed document that could be parsed by `xpp::XmlPullParser`,
 * or it may be more complex:
 *
 * - A fragment may contain a reference to externally defined markup. Such a reference may be
 *   detected by the parser and the referenced content is seamlessly injected into the sequence
 *   of events returned by the parser. The external fragment controls whether it replaces the
 *   referencing element or descends from it.
 * - A fragment may contain embedded markup, which is either CDATA-enclosed or XML-encoded XML
 *   content that a traditional parser would treat as text. Such embedded markup may be detected
 *   by the parser and the content is seamlessly injected into the sequence of events returned
 *   by the parser. The embedded fragment controls whether it replaces the parent of the embedded
 *   text or remains descended from that element.
 * - A parser event consumer may define locations within a fragment where external content should
 *   be injected into the parser's sequence of events. The parser can be compelled to parse such
 *   content on demand. The caller cannot control how existing content is handled.
 * - A fragment may be a sequence of XML elements with no root element.
 *
 * `xpp::IXmlPullParser` declares the entire public interface of `xpp::XmlPullParser`. It is also
 * the base of `fxpp::IFragmentedXmlPullparser`. Migration of existing code to use the framework
 * requires replacing references to `xpp::XmlPullParser` with the appropriate interface,
 * `xpp::IXmlPullParser` when framework extensions are not required and
 * `fxpp::IFragmentedXmlPullParser` when framework extensions are required. Additional changes may
 * be necessary, but such details depend upon individual implementations of the interface.
 *
 * To parse a single fragment, as is currently done using `xpp::XmlPullParser`, an instance of
 * `fxpp::IFragmentedXmlPullParser`, which extends `xpp::IXmlPullParser`, supports parsing similar
 * to `xpp::XmlPullParser`. Each implementation is free to deviate from the expected behavior, and
 * the default implementation prohibits the use of mixed content.
 *
 * To parse multiple fragments with manual control of additional fragments, an instance of
 * `fxpp::IFragmentedXmlPullParser` will accept new fragments with the `injectFragment` method.
 * This method cannot be called before the first `START_TAG` is reported, nor can it be called
 * after the balancing `END_TAG` is reported.
 *
 * To parse multiple fragments with automatic detection of external fragment references, an instance
 * of `fxpp::IFragmentedXmlAssistant` must be registered with the `fxpp::IFragmentedXmlPullParser`
 * instance. The assistant implementation is responsible for recognizing which markup elements may
 * specify external fragment references, which of those that may specify a reference actually do
 * specify external fragment references, loading the referenced markup, and passing it back to the
 * parser.
 * 
 * To parse multiple fragments with automatic detection of embedded fragment content, an instance
 * of `fxpp::IFragmentedXmlAssistant` must be registered with the `fxpp::IFragmentedXmlPullParser`
 * instance. The assistant implementation is responsible for recognizing which markup elements may
 * contain embedded fragment content, which of those that may contain a fragment actually do contain
 * embedded fragment content, and passing it back to the parser as a new fragment.
 * 
 * A default implementation of `fxpp::IFragmentedXmlAssistant` is provided which includes
 * handling of both automatic scenarios. Refer to `fxpp::fxa::IAssistant` for more details.
